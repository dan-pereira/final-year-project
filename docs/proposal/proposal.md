> Ensure that the Supervisor formally agrees to supervise your project; this is only recognised once the
> Supervisor assigns herself/himself via the project Dashboard.
>
> Project proposals without an assigned
> Supervisor will not be accepted for presentation to the Approval Panel.

## SECTION B

> Guidance: This document is expected to be approximately 3 pages in length, but it can exceed this page limit.
> It is also permissible to carry forward content from this proposal to your later documents (e.g. functional
> specification) as appropriate.
>
> Your proposal must include *at least* the following sections.


### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

Our idea for our Final Year Project is to create a Smart Garden. This will allow us to create an environment for plants to grow without any need to look after them.
Users will have the option to take full control at any time or leave the garden as is without any input as the garden will maintain as ideal conditions as possible for the plant to survive. 


### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

We had the idea over our INTRA placement. The idea came from a project seen during work experience and noting that a house plant had died during the summer when we were away. 
The idea came to us as we wanted a way to be able to be away from home for extended periods of time and not need to worry about house plants. 

### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?

### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

1. Python 
2. Javascript 
3. Bash 

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

We are hoping to use the following to implement our project. 
1. AWS EC2 for server running nginx with a custom-built UI to interface with the Smart Garden
2. Python to implement backend and aws greengrass to communicate with raspberry pi

### Hardware
> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.
1. Servo to turn on/off pump
2. Temperature sensor in soil 
3. PH level sensor for soil
4. Soil moisture level 


### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

1. Working with IOT 
2. Integrating project dashboard with IOT devices (sensors, pi etc.)

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
