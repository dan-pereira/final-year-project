Git workflow
============

###Description
For the development of our project we will be taking inspiration from atlassian's [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow.
The reason for this is to help structure our workflow process.
It will also help for us to track any integration changes for specific features.

###Process
The Gitflow Workflow uses branching define new features and bugfixes relative to development and production.

###Branch Naming Strategy
| Branch | Description |
|  ----- | ----------- |
| master | Working code ready for deployment |
| develop | An integration branch for features |
| feature/ | Any branches introducing a new feature |
| bugfix/ | For any unexpected changes to master |
